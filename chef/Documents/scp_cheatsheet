Notes: 

— SCP Example:  scp -r  root@123.123.123.123:/var/www/html/ /home/hydn/backups/test/ Also see: Backup solutions.

— Host can be IP or domain name. Once you click return, you will be prompted for SSH password.

— Although this page covers SCP Linux, the instructions will also work for Mac using “Terminal”. You can also use WinSCP to accomplish this on a Windows PC/server.

— When copying a source file to a target file which already exists, scp will replace the contents of the target file. So be careful.
